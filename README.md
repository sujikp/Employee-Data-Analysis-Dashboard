# Employee-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

*  This Project is to explore 20 questions using tools like MS Excel and Power BI.

*  To optimize organizational performance by analyzing employee data, engagement surveys, training, development, and recruitment processes.

  1. Can you create a pivot table to summarize the total number of employees in each department?

  2. Apply conditional formatting to highlight employees with a "Performance Score" below 3 in red.

  3. Calculate the average "Satisfaction Score" for male and female employees separately using a pivot table.

  4. Create a chart to visualize the distribution of "Work-Life Balance Score" for different job functions.

  5. Filter the data to display only terminated employees and find out the most common "Termination Type."

  6. Calculate the average "Engagement Score" for each department using a pivot table.

  7. Use VLOOKUP to find the supervisor's email address for a specific employee.

  8. Can you identify the department with the highest average "Employee Rating?"

  9. Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between "Training Duration (Days)" and "Training Cost."

  10. Build a pivot table that shows the count of employees by "RaceDesc" and "GenderCode."

  15. Apply advanced conditional formatting to highlight the top 10% and bottom 10% of employees based on "Current Employee Rating." 

  16. Use a calculated field in a pivot table to determine the average "Engagement Score" per year. 

  17. Can you build a macro that automates the process of updating and refreshing all pivot tables in the workbook?

  18. Create a histogram to understand the distribution of "ExitDate" for terminated employees.

  19. Utilize the SUMPRODUCT function to calculate the total training cost for employees in a specific location.
